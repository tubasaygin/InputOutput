“Why do you come to play here at all?
Only just round the corner are the shady trees,
and the birds singing on the branches, and the sunshine is flecking the pathway.
Who knows but what, out there, your ball might touch the sky?
Here you will only disturb me,
and perhaps spoil the roses,
and at best you can but hit the ceiling!”
But throw high dear sister, or we shall never hit the ceiling.
